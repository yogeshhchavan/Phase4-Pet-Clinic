Overview:  
This project focuses on planning and developing a robust backend solution for 
a clinic application that manages online data for pets, their owners, and consultation 
fees. The assignment emphasizes gaining practical experience in creating a CI/CD 
pipeline using Jenkins to streamline development and deployment processes. 
Additionally, it involves containerizing the application with Docker to ensure 
consistent environments and scalability. The final goal is to deploy and host the 
software on an AWS EC2 instance, enabling online accessibility and e icient 
infrastructure management.

Update, Delete).  
• Robust error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.  
2. CI/CD Pipeline:  
• Automated build and test processes using Jenkins pipelines.  
• Seamless integration with Git for version control and deployment 
tracking.  
• Continuous deployment to AWS EC2, ensuring the latest updates 
are live with minimal downtime.  
3. Containerization:  
• Dockerized backend for consistent environments across 
development, testing, and production.  
• Easy scaling and portability with Docker containers.  
• Simplified multi-service orchestration using Docker Compose if 
required.  
4. Cloud Hosting:
